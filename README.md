# Desktop-Ubuntu-Nix
My configs for Ubuntu LTS base, with Nix and home-manager on top, and Hyprland desktop.


Check install notes first, then look at the conf files for inspiration, dont copy everything blind, specially home.nix and flake.nix

## TODO
Some stuff that needs to be fixed.
- [ ] Screensharing, havent got this working. Looks like xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland is working. Suspect it could be an issue with pipewire or wireplumber. obs-studio does not find pipewire support.
- [ ] Swaylock, unclock will fail.
